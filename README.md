# The project moved to https://github.com/gabriel-v/protolegi

This is the repo we used during the JSHacks hackathon in Oct, 2016.
While that hackathon has ended, the project has not.

Until we decide whether to make a GitHub organization or not, [this](https://github.com/gabriel-v/protolegi) will be the place to submit feedback and contributions.

For historic purposes, the old readme is kept below.

# Pending Laws Transparency

This project makes the public data about Romanian pending laws searchable.
The original sites have no search engines and are hard to navigate.
